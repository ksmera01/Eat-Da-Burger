## Description

  Welcome to Eat Da Burger! This newly designed restaurant app makes it simple to order new burgers on our menu. Once you add a burger to your queue, you can save it for later or devour it! This burger logger was created using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. Please enjoy the new ordering functionality and we hope you visit again!
